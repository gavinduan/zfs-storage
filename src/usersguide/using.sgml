<title>The Thumper Replica Roll</title>

<para>
The main component of the Thumper Replica Roll is the /opt/rocks/sbin/zfs-backup Perl script (<xref linkend="replica-script">).
This script is installed only on Solaris 10+ machine since it needs ZFS to run.
When executed it creates a snapshot of a ZFS file system on the replica host where it is executed 
(called source replica host from now on), and then it sends a copy of this snapshot to a second 
host (destination replicat host).
</para>

<para>
This roll provides also a set of <filename>rocks</filename> commands which can be used to to create the approriate 
crontab entries to invoke the zfs-backup perl script (<xref linkend="rocks-commands">).

    <title>The replica script command line</title>
    <para>The command line syntax is:</para>
    <screen>
      Usage: ./zfs-backup.pl [args]
	Options: -z &lt;zfs filesystem to be replicatedi&gt;
	         -k &lt;/path/to/ssh/key&gt; this paramters is optional
	         -r &lt;FQDN of replicant host&gt;
	         -f remote ZFS filesystem to hold the backup data. If not present default is export/backups/
	         -h Display help

	-z -r are the only required parameters, the others have a default value.

	Example: ./zfs-backup.pl -z export/foo -k /root/key -r z.com -i zfspool1 

	The remote zfs filesytem path must point to the first level of the remote zfs where the user
	wants to place the data. No starting trailing slash. With the previous example data will be
	placed on /zfspool1/backup/&lt;hostname&gt;/export/foo@SNAPSHOT2009-04-08-1239214747

    <para>Below there are extra infomation on some flags:</para>
     <orderedlist>
     <listitem><para>
    -z specifies the local zfs file system to be backed up (this is the zfs file system and not the 
    path!).
     </para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>
    -r is the hostname that will be used to ssh to the remote replica host (before running the zfs-backup
    try ssh &lt;hostname&gt; to verify your configuration!).
     </para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>
    -f is the remote file system as explained above (note that also this is a zfs file system and not 
    the path!).
     </para></listitem>
     </orderedlist>

    <para>The option -z -r, are mandatory. If the -k is not specified the default location is used. 
    The script keeps a set of log files in <filename>/var/log/zfs-backup</filename>, if you are having 
    problems look at the log files.</para>
